## Vectors 

```{r}
# Create a vector
dogs <- c("teddy", "khora", "waffle", "banjo", "tallie")

# Check the class
class(dogs)
```

```{r}
cats <- c("creamsicle wolf", 14.2, 3L)
class(cats)
# Categorized as character because vector can only be 1 type of class and it will take the most flexible class
```

```{r}
years <- c(20, 40, 16, 2)
class(years)

# typeof function gives you higher resolution of class
typeof(years)

# to get it to return the years vector as an integer class add an L next to each number
```

```{r}
# Want to do a conditional check
# is. <<< asks questions "is this THIS"
# as. <<< gives a command "make this THIS"

is.numeric(years)
is.character(years)
```

```{r}
# Assign names to values in a vector
dog_food <- c(teddy = "purina", khora = "alpo", waffle = "fancy feast")

dog_food

dog_food[2]

dog_food["khora"]
```
